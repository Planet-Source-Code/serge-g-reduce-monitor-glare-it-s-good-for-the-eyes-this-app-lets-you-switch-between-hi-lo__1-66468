### Description

As most people(Over the age of 3-5) remember, stores used to sell tinted screens, that go over the monitor to protect vision. Well, this app does that with out using any hardware items. Also, a good demo for using taskbar to minimize a form. When minimized, it automatically appears in tasbar as an appropriate icon(monitor low has one icon, high has another) Once in taskbar, you can use it directly from there by right-clicking on it.

*NOTE, IMPORTANT: When using in IDE, please be sure to end properly, through the form - not VBEditor(Clicking stop will cause the screen to remain in its current state(Low/High) and you will have to reboot.
